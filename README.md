#Conway's Game of Life
Demonstration of Conways Game of Life exercise using angular and bower.

#Installation
Start with NPM. It comes with node so you can check the version with:
```
npm --version
```
Otherwise install via command line:
```
curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```
Next you'll need bower:
```
npm install -g bower
```
Then use bower to install angular, underscore, and require:
```
bower install angular
bower install underscore
bower install require
```

Finally I use serve to run my server:
```
npm install -g serve
```

To run the server type serve in the console and it will auto start a server. Add -p and a port number if you don't want to use the default (serve -p 3001)
